Welcome! Berry Good Smoothies is an application for people looking to start eating healthier. This app allows you to input nutrients you're looking to add into your everyday diet and recommend a smoothie that has the nutrients required! Simply input a single value and the app will not only show you the smoothie best fitting but it will also show how to make it with a list of ingredients.

This is the menu screen. The tool of my application. Here, you will find a list of nutrients that one might look for in a healthy smoothie. By choosing one you will be directed to the next screen populated with only smoothies that contain the nutrient you selected. 

### Pick Your Smoothie Screen

Once you pick the nutrient you're looking for you will be guided to this screen. On this screen is a list of smoothies to choose from. Once clicked on you will be directed to a recipe screen. At the top of this screen you will notice a button. This button will take you to a website that contains only smoothies that fit the nutrient you're looking for.

This application has a social media section with a list of local smoothie places you can find the smoothies you see in my application. It will take you to their instagram pages where you can give them a follow, or simply find their contact information.

### Credits Screen

THe credits screen has all images assets used in this application. All but one were created by myself with the use of Abobe Photoshop and Abobe Illustrator.

### Settings Screen
